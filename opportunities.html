							<h3>Opportunities</h3>
							<p>August 2020</p>

							<p>
								

The lab is currently seeking a PhD student for a funded research assitantship via a NASA Funded LCLUC (Land Cover/Land Cover Change) Grant to start in August 2021. The project, titled "Making the Hidden Visible: Accelerated Land-Use Change and Degradation Caused by Narco-Trafficking In and Around Central Americaâ€™s Protected Areas" is a collaborative grant with Dr. Nicholas Magliocca and Dr. Matt Fagan.
The research assistant will map clandestine infrastructure (airstrips and roads) in protected areas in Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica. We will be using multi-sensor fusion (optical and radar, including high resolution Planetscope data) and deep learning models to identify infrastructure.
Interested students should send an email to Beth-> et2663 [at] columbia.edu with their CV and a sample of writing they are proud of.

This project is a unique opportunity to work with a multi-discplinary research team of ecologists, ethnographers, and land change scientists to better understand the social and ecological impacts of the drug trade and US War on Drugs in Central America.

I am also recruiting potential postdoctoral fellows to start in August 2021. Email me for expressions of interest. 

PhD and Master's applicants should have either expertise in or a willingness to learn satellite image analysis, programming, and quantitative skills. Applicants must also demonstrate a committment to building a more socially just world.

We are devoted to building a diverse, inclusive, and anti-racist lab. Women and all expressions of gender identity, Black, Indigenous, and people of Color, LGBTQ people, and individuals with disabilities are especially encouraged to apply.

							<h3>Environmental Science Senior Practicum</h3>
							<p>Winter and spring quarters, 2019</p>

							<p>
								During the two-quarter practicum, seniors in Environmental Science work with an outside organization to solve an important problem related to the environment or sustainability. Over winter and spring of 2019, our practicum group is working with the NRDC to improve estimates of air pollution near the Port of Los Angeles related to diesel truck emissions.
