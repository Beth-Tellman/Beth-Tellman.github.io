							<h3>Opportunities</h3>
							<p>June 2021</p>

							<p>
								

								The lab is currently seeking one postdoctoral scientist for a NASA funded project to start in Summer 2021 (June 1 preferred , but flexible). Apply through the <a href="https://arizona.csod.com/ux/ats/careersite/4/home/requisition/4246?c=arizona"> University of Arizona portal</a>.
							</p>
		

							</p>
							<p>
								 "Mapping flood impacts using multi-sensor satellite data fusion in urban areas." 
								This project will use optical and radar satellite sensors, precipitation, and topography variables to generate per-pixel probabilities of inundation in urban areas at 30m resolution every 3 days.
								We will validate our approach in 6 cities in Sub-Saharan Africa, South-east Asia, and the United States. 
								This project is joint with the Columbia Water Center (Co-I Upmanu Lall and Pierre Gentine) and the University of Virginia (Co-I Venkat Lakshmi).
								The student and post doc will gain a multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary perspective by working with hydrologists, climatologists,
								machine learning specialists, and humanitarian practitioners from the Red Cross. 
								The postdoc will work with the PI and PhD students to develop two modeling approaches- supervised machine learning through convolutional neural networks (CNN) 
								and GANs (General Adversarial Networks) for spatial and spectral super resolution and an unsupervised approach through Bayesian networks. 
								Funded summer travel and extended stays in New York City to work with the project team are included in this project. 
								This three-year project is supported by NASA's Terrestrial Hydrology Program (THP).

<h3>Human Environment Geography</h3>
							<p>
							
I am a human-environment geographer seeking to understand, map, and mitigate the causes and consequences of global environmental change with and for marginalized populations. I engage in a wide array of disciplines and methods from land system science, to hydrology, to the social sciences.  
I will be Assistant Professor of Geography at the University of Arizona in August 2021 and am recruiting PhD students and postdocs that are fully funded! Send your CV, a piece of writing you are proud of, and an expression of interest to my email. PhD and Master's applicants should have either expertise in or a willingness to learn satellite image analysis, programming, and quantitative skills. Applicants must also demonstrate a commitment to building a more socially just world.
We are devoted to building a diverse, inclusive, and anti-racist lab. Women and all expressions of gender identity, Black, Indigenous, and people of Color, LGBTQ people, and individuals with disabilities are especially encouraged to apply.
							Funding support for application fees is available for students from low and middle income countries- please indicate this in an email to me.
								PhD applications will be accepted for Fall 2022 in January 2022.
