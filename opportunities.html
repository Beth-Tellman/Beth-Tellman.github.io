							<h3>Opportunities</h3>
							
							<h4>PhD students Fall 2022</h4>

							<p>
								

We are recruiting PhD students to join our lab in Fall 2022 with full funding available and opportunities to work on <a href="https://beth-tellman.github.io/ProjectsandMedia.html">NASA-funded projects</a> using machine learning on satellite imagery.
We are producing time series data for inundation in urban areas, infrastructure in protected areas in Central America, and flooding across Bangladesh. In 2022 will begin to apply these datasets to better understand and mitigate human losses of global environmental change. For example, we will assess indirect drivers of forest loss in Central America, and 
								support development of flood finance (e.g. index insurance, forecast based finance) in Bangladesh. Your PhD project does NOT need to be connected to your research assistantship, but you will have the option to do so!
							</p>
							<h4>Postdocs Spring 2022</h4>

							<p>						
We are hiring a post-doctoral researcher to join our lab in Spring 2022								
								to assess the role of clandestine infrastructure in deforestation in Central America through an existing NASA grant and develop new projects/proposals to study the role of illicit activity in land change.
In this role, you will use machine learning with satellite imagery, news media, and other data sources on human behavior to quantify the role of illicit activity. There is also oppportunity to collaborate on and support other flood mapping projects in our lab.								
This is an exciting opportunity to work with large interdisciplinary research teams and non-academic partners at the intersection of remote sensing and social science. Current post docs Jonathan and Rohit will be at AGU 2022 in person if you are going and want to connect with the lab in person! <a href="https://arizona.csod.com/ux/ats/careersite/4/home/requisition/7581?c=arizona">Apply here! </a>
							
										
							</p>
<h3>Human Environment Geography</h3>
							<p>
							
I am a human-environment geographer seeking to understand, map, and mitigate the causes and consequences of global environmental change with and for marginalized populations. I engage in a wide array of disciplines and methods from land system science, to hydrology, to the social sciences.  
I am recruiting PhD students and postdocs that are fully funded. Send your CV, a piece of writing you are proud of, and an expression of interest to my email. PhD and Master's applicants should have either expertise in or a willingness to learn satellite image analysis, programming, and quantitative skills. Applicants must also demonstrate a commitment to building a more socially just world.
We are devoted to building a diverse, inclusive, and anti-racist lab. Women and all expressions of gender identity, Black, Indigenous, and people of Color, LGBTQ people, and individuals with disabilities are especially encouraged to apply.
							Funding support for application fees is available for students from low and middle income countries- please indicate this in an email to me.
								PhD applications will be accepted for Fall 2022 in January 2022.
