								<h4>Sam Baugh</h4>
								<p>Third year graduate student, Statistics</p>
							</header>
							<p>Sam is a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at UCLA. Prior to starting my PhD, he received his MS in Statistics from the University of Chicago advised by Michael Stein, where he worked on computational techniques for non-stationary spatial modeling. His current research is focused on statistical analysis of Argo temperature data in order to better understand how ocean heat content is changing in response to anthropogenic global warming.<br><br>

Prior to his PhD studies, Russell was employed at the Joint Global Change Research Institute, where he worked with an integrated assessment model to study deep decarbonization scenarios and the relationship between building energy use and the climate system. He is interested in extreme weather events and interactions between the climate and human systems<br><br>

								<h4>Pete Jourgensen</h4>
								<p>Masters' Student, Computer Science</p>
							</header>
							<p>Pete is a second year Masters student of Computer Science at UCLA whose focus has been on machine learning methods and neural networks. Currently, he is developing a deep learning model for longlead forecasting of extreme heat events based on sea surface temperatures. Previously, he received his Bachelors in Applied Mathematics from Northwestern University, where he studied PDE approximation methods. He then worked as an options trader in Chicago, where he discovered his passions lie in analyzing and uncovering narratives hidden in data. Nowadays, when he's not cleaning data, he enjoys climbing, trail running, and backpacking around the Sierras!<br><br>

								<h4>Chris Reed</h4>
								<p>Senior, Environmental Science</p>
							</header>
							<p>Chris is a 4th year environmental science major at UCLA passionate about data. He is broadly interested in understanding the impacts of climate change on food security and agriculture through techniques in data science and statistics. His research involves developing statistical models to identify the influence of climate variables on crop yields. He is particularly interested in the impacts of temperature on yields of high value crops in California.<br><br>

					<h3>Prospective graduate students</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I admit graduate students through both the <a href="http://statistics.ucla.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> and the <a href="https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/">Institute of the Environment and Sustainability</a>. For students interested in IoES, I plan to accept one student to focus on connected hydroclimate extremes through a funded NSF proposal led by Drs. <a href="https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/person/daniel-swain/">Daniel Swain</a> and <a href="https://staff.ucar.edu/users/done">James Done</a> (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2AVVsFXbYH4bzM2SzNRem9lQlZXbTlUbVFyVlQyakcwUHFV/view?usp=sharing">more information</a>).</p>

					<h3>Prospective post-docs</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I do not currently have funding for project-specific post-docs, but welcome you to contact me if you are interested in applying to a post-doctoral fellowship. Some potential funding sources for post-docs are the <a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc">NOAA Global Change post-doc</a>, the various <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3">NSF post-docs</a>, the <a href="https://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/">McDonnell Foundation post-doc</a>, and the <a href="https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/overview/">Schmidt Science Fellows</a>. In addition, the University of California system supports the <a href="https://grad.ucla.edu/funding/working-at-ucla/postdocs/presidents-postdoctoral-fellowship-program/">President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program</a> for female and minority PhD recipients.</p>
