        <h2>Temperature extremes, and changes in temperature distributions</h2>
        <p> The last decade has featured a seemingly anomalous number of extreme weather events,
        including heat waves and cold snaps. These extreme events can be expensive and dangerous, yet
        their behavior does not necessarily follow that of the mean, and they are often ill-predicted.
        Changes in extremes are closely connected to changes in temperature distributions, and
        I am exploring the spatial variability in the changes of different percentiles in temperature
        using ground-based station data. It appears that many of these changes can be explained by the underlying
        non-normality in surface temperature distributions. Finally, I am interested in
        the potential for long-lead predictability of specific types of extreme events based on
        climatic precursors, with a current focus on heat waves in the Eastern US. <br>

        <h2>The seasonal cycle</h2>
		<p>
		The seasonal cycle in surface temperature may be one of the most familiar aspects of climate,
		with effects ranging from animal migration to crop planting to tourism. The annual range of
		temperature in many locations is larger than the difference between glacial and interglacial
		times, and certainly larger than the present-day anthropogenic warming signal.
		I am interested in understanding the processes most important for
		determining the climatological seasonal cycle, and their implications for future
		changes in seasonality.<br>

		<h2>Spatial patterns of warming</h2>
		<p>
		Climate change is often discussed with reference to changes in the global mean temperature,
		but the spatially-resolved pattern of warming has more relevance to the on-the-ground
		experience of climate change. Understanding the observed pattern of warming has implications
		for the balance of radiative forcing, feedbacks, transport, and heat storage in causing
		temperature change. The presently-observed spatial pattern of temperature change is similar
		to the amplitude of the seasonal cycle, suggesting that similar physical processes are
		at play on both timescales.<br>

		<h2>Mountain glaciers</h2>
		<p>
		Mountain glaciers respond to changes in temperature and precipitation, and can provide
		a record of past climate changes in their moraines. Interpreting these moraine records,
		however, requires a careful consideration of the local environment of the glacier, including
		the coupling between the ice and solid earth via erosion, transport, and deposition of
		sediment, which I have previously explored in the context of the Last Glacial Maximum
		Pukaki Glacier in New Zealand. Mountain glaciers are also responding to modern-day
		climate change, making monitoring increasingly important. During (Northern Hemisphere)
		spring 2014, I participated in a <a href="http://agribotix.com/blog/2014/3/22/tasman-glacier-survey-completed">
		small field campaign</a> using drones to take thousands of
		aerial photos of Tasman Glacier, which can be <a href="http://agribotix.com/blog/2014/3/24/let-the-computation-begin">stitched together</a> to make a three-dimensional
		digital elevation model of the glacier for use in velocity modeling and long-term volume
		monitoring. More blog entries about the campaign are <a href="http://agribotix.com/blog/?tag=Tasman+campaign">here</a>.

		<h2>
		Model philosophy</h2>
		<p>
		The climate system is extremely complex, with important processes spanning a wide
		range of spatial and temporal scales. Creating models that are also complex, however,
		leads to challenges in interpreting both the actual climate system and the climate models.
		Model evaluation through established frameworks in information theory and machine
		learning can assist in choosing models that maximize information content and avoid
		overly high variance.
