                <hr>

                <p>Last Thursday, on International Women's Day, I had the great pleasure of delivering the keynote address for the <a href = "https://nmtechcouncil.org/women-in-technology-celebration/">10th annual Women in Technology celebration</a> hosted by the <a href = "https://nmtechcouncil.org/">New Mexico Technology Council</a>. As part of the event, we got to hear from women in tech at various stage of their careers reflect on the challenges and great rewards of being a woman in tech - and celebrate an impressive cohort of high school girls who are already coding away. New Mexico may be a small state, but I'm continually impressed at the high-achieving, driven women I've been meeting through the technology community here.</p>

                <p>Here is the text of the speech I gave:</p>

                <p>Good morning. I am so excited to be gathered with you all on International Women’s Day to celebrate the many amazing women in technology in New Mexico. We’ll be honoring some of those women later on this morning, but I want to start with thanking all of you for being here, whether you are a woman in tech or simply an advocate.</p>

                <p>Today, I want to share with you a number of stories of women in the west. Stories that are my own, stories that are those of people I know and love, and stories of women that I’ve never met but whose lives inspire me. I have a strong belief that we are all shaped by the environment around us, and here in New Mexico we have the privilege of living under wide open skies, surrounded by and awed by the vastness of the desert, that allows for -- or even encourages -- fresh starts and new beginnings.</p>

                <p>This feeling was certainly shared by a group of pioneering women who settled in and around Santa Fe in the early 1900s, a set of stories I learned about from Lesley Polling-Kempe’s book Ladies of the Canyons. I recommend the book itself, but today I’ll briefly mention the story of Natalie Curtis. Natalie was raised in an elite New York City family and excelled at music. For years, her goal was to be a concert pianist -- a goal that ran straight into the belief that women were meant to be in the home, supporting a husband, not on the concert stage, or pursuing any type of career. Instead of forcing herself to follow the path of a housewife, she decided to head west, and ultimately fell in love with and settled in Santa Fe. Away from the confines of eastern US society, she turned her love of music towards the goal of celebrating and recording the great diversity of Native American music, despite the fact that celebrating Native American music was in strict conflict with the federal Indian policy at the time. She became close with many tribal members across the southwest, and ultimately published multiple anthologies of music that provided an education in Native American culture to the rest of America. But what I find so inspiring about her story, beyond her professional accomplishments, was her desire and ability to transition a life in New York with all of its modern trappings to one in the more rugged southwest. And Natalie Curtis was not alone in this: she was surrounded by women such as Carol Stanley and Mary Cabot Wheelwright who also came to the southwest for freedom, and ultimately left their mark here through accomplishments such as the establishment of Ghost Ranch and the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian.</p>

                <p>When these women came from the east to the southwest, they added their stories to a rich cultural history already in progress in the southwest. While we tend to have fewer written histories of the Native American tribes that have lived in the southwest for centuries before the arrival of the Spanish, we know that many of them, including the Hopi and the Navajo, built matrilineal societies with an underlying value of gender egalitarianism. While women and men tended to play different roles, the roles were complementary rather than hierarchical. I like to view the present-day southwest in the context of this history, of gender equality and women stepping out of the norm and breaking new ground.</p>

                <p>My own story proceeded in the opposite direction, geographically. I was raised one state north, under the open skies of Colorado. As a child, I had the privilege of being raised by two scientists in an environment where it seemed that gender was no barrier to my career. I was encouraged to take advanced math and science courses from a young age, and knew both male and female scientists through my schools and my parents. That’s not to say that no one tried to warn me: my mom, who had already fought many-a-battle as a woman in science and tech, had her war stories. She told me of being passed over for promotions, of finding out that she was getting paid less than her male counterparts. Besides these systematic issues, she experienced workplace environments built for men -- and a particular type of man at that. In one particularly egregious case, her full team was called into the break room to celebrate someone’s birthday. But in addition to the usual sheet cake to share with the office, someone had hired a woman to come in to perform a strip tease and lap dance for the “birthday boy”. To make things worse, the lap dancer turned to my mom -- the only other woman in the room -- and asked her to help out. While this event happened about 20 years ago, we now know that similar -- and worse -- things are still happening behind closed doors around the country. But when my mother first told me these stories, I figured that they were better placed into history than relevant for my own life.</p>

                <p>At age 18, I moved from Colorado to Boston, where I spent most of the next decade. Suddenly, I found myself immersed in a culture very different from the one where I had grown up, and I began to understand that my mom’s stories of the challenges of being a woman in STEM lived not only in the past, but also in the present. As I looked around my classes at Harvard, it was impossible not to notice that I was one of only a handful of women in a math class of one hundred, or to realize that I didn’t have a single female professor or teaching assistant in any of my math and science classes. Despite all the advantages I had growing up -- being the daughter of two scientists, getting an excellent public education throughout 12th grade -- imposter syndrome began to gnaw away at me. For those who have never been in a situation where they are so clearly a minority, I think it is hard to explain just how powerful and negative this feeling can be. But for those of us -- likely most people in this room -- who have looked around and seen a dearth of both peers and role models, I think you all know what I mean.</p>

                <p>After getting my bachelors, I returned to Harvard for my PhD. I joined the climate dynamics program that had no female faculty, no female post-docs, and only three other female graduate students. After my first year, two of those three women left the program, again making it difficult to not notice how alone, and how different, I was in the room. I started thinking a lot about why it was so hard to be a woman in science, despite all the other advantages I had -- race, class, education, a supportive family. I almost left my program and -- without all of those other advantages -- it’s possible that I would have. For this reason, I am continually amazed and inspired by women who are minorities in other ways, whether their race, sexual identity, or economic background, who still wake up everyday and pursue their careers as scientists and engineers. But instead of quitting, I decided to try to take action. I sat down with the hiring committee in my department and explained why it was so important to hire a diverse set of faculty so that women and underrepresented minorities could have role models that look like them. I got in touch with the women in my field at a nearby university, and started a peer mentoring group that served as part professional network and part therapy session. I called my mom, and commiserated about how little had changed since her generation.</p>

                <p>I did ultimately finish my PhD, and by the time I was done I had not only become a Dr. but also an advocate for women in science and tech. My hope is that I can help to make at least a few women’s journeys easier, or at least provide an open ear for their struggles and successes.</p>

                <p>I’m sure that every woman here has their own stories of when they first felt the negative pull of imposter syndrome, or of not being taken seriously because of their gender. Unfortunately, some women in this room will also have stories of sexual harassment, assault, and rape, which are all still used to marginalize and subjugate women even in 2018. We’ve gone a long way as a country in terms of gender equality, but we still have a long way to go.</p>

                <p>Currently, women earn only 30% of undergraduate degrees in science and technology. In computer science, the hottest new major, that number is 18%, and it has been largely decreasing since the 1980s. Once they’re out of school, women tend to only hold about a quarter of tech jobs. In these jobs, they get paid less on average and are twice as likely to quit.</p>

                <p>There is, however, a flip side of this coin. The flip side is that we know that women are as capable, as talented, as driven, as smart, etc. as all of the men filling most of the technology jobs today. And we know that there are many tech jobs to fill today, there will be even more in the future, and that these jobs tend to be highly-paid. So, if we can change the culture of the technology field, we can begin to fill these tech jobs with all of the talented women and men out there. And I think that New Mexico is a wonderful place to invest in this change. The state already stands out as having a high percentage of female home and business owners, and Albuquerque was recently rated as the 5th best city in the US for women in tech, in large part because of its rapidly shrinking gender pay gap. Finally, we have the room -- and a need -- to grow, in order to support our schools with a sufficient tax base, and to provide good professional jobs for people who want to come to or stay in New Mexico.</p>

                <p>I’m a newcomer to New Mexico, but from what I’ve seen, we already have the most important resource for this growth -- namely, a phenomenal set of driven, smart, and talented women. I’ve met Elisa, who grew up in Las Cruces, and after leaving the state for college, returned to her hometown to teach computer science in high school, and is now working to create a school to provide the students of south Santa Fe with a better education. I’ve met Diana, who is working to determine the strategic future directions for Sandia National Lab. I’ve met Jennifer, who is aiming to bring computer science education and technical jobs to youth across the state, including in the many Pueblos. And of course, I’ve met the women who work at Descartes Labs with me, who are doing everything from providing early warnings of drought in the middle east to mapping agriculture in Indonesia. I’m excited that we’ll have the chance to honor one of those women, Caitlin, later this morning, who not only excels at her technical job, but also has spent her time outside of work empowering girls in Santa Fe through her work with Girls Inc.</p>

                <p>Today, I think we have the great opportunity to shape New Mexico into a state where women in tech can thrive. To do so, we need to not only draw more technology jobs to the state, but also come together to support the development of a different type of culture: fewer tech bros, more people using their talents to simply do good work. The first step towards this transformation is supporting women and girls in tech at all stages, ranging from ensuring that computer science classes are available and gender balanced to developing strong support networks. On this second point, I want to leave you all with a call to action: never underestimate the power of mentoring and networks. If you’re not already doing it, I hope you’ll consider starting a peer network for the women in tech in your region, or volunteering your time to provide a strong female role model to younger women. We all have the power to make the path towards a career in tech just a little bit easier for the next woman in line. And for the men in the room, I have one more ask: in addition to supporting and mentoring, be a public voice for gender equality and family issues in the workplace. Too often, this burden falls to women, but we need all the help we can get to begin to change the culture in tech and beyond.</p>

                <p>And with that, I want to thank you all for being here today, and I can’t wait to work with you to foster a new generation of western women breaking new ground in technology.</p>

                <hr>

                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p>As an occassional twitter user, I was well aware of the number of bots on the platform. The ones I interacted with were not created by Russian trolls to spread fake news, but rather by normal folks in order to retweet content that was of interest, such as new journal articles in a field or tweets related to their company. Over the Thanksgiving holiday, I realized that a bot had even entered the family, as I saw my brother's <a href = "https://twitter.com/danielmckinn0n">twitter account</a> tweet away while he was sailing the South Pacific, far from the nearest wifi router.</p>

                <p>So, with the Christmas holiday over but vacation still continuing, I decided it was time to make my first twitter bot. The hardest part of making a bot is surely deciding what it should do: retweet tweets about a topic? offer its own content created through machine learning algorithms? I opted to merge this mini project with a larger, in-progress one that is based upon the thousands of New Yorker captions that are submited to the weekly caption contest but do not win. At this time, these losing captions are simply listed <a href = "https://contest.newyorker.com/CaptionContest.aspx?tab=archive">online</a> in an inset scroll box deep within the caption contest website. Why not make a bot that randomly tweets the losing captions, so they too have their chance to shine?</p>

                <p>The harder work of scraping the New Yorker website had already been done by my partner in crime, so I began with a database of old cartoons and captions to work with. The next steps were relatively straightforward thanks to the twitter API and some python infrastructure built around it.</p>

                <p><b>First</b>, decide whether you want to turn your pre-existing twitter account into a bot, or create a new one. Since I created a new one, I needed to first create an email address for it (I used gmail), and then create the twitter account. Although twitter accounts themselves don't require your phone number, the app that ultimately allows your handle to be a bot does, so do use your phone number when registering.</p>

                <p><b>Second</b>, go to https://apps.twitter.com/, log in as your new (or old) twitter account, and click "Create New App". Fill out the necessary information (name, description, website), agree  to the terms of service, and you're good to go! Note that you need to give your application read and write access to the account; this is the default and should not be changed.</p>


                <p><b>Third</b>, make your bot! I created my bot using python. If you want to use python but don't have it on your machine, I suggest downloading and installing the anaconda distribution (information and links <a href = "https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html">here</a>). You will also need to install tweepy via:</p>

                <p><code>pip install tweepy</code></p>

                <p>at the command line.</p>

                <p>This first code snippet gives your bot access to the twitter account via the tokens we got through setting up the app. The ones below are stand-ins; look for yours in the tab titled "Keys and Access Tokens" in the twitter Application Management window.</p>

                <pre><code>
import tweepy
CONSUMER_KEY = 'aaaa'
CONSUMER_SECRET = 'bbbb'
ACCESS_KEY = 'cccc'
ACCESS_SECRET = 'dddd'
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET)
auth.set_access_token(ACCESS_KEY, ACCESS_SECRET)
api = tweepy.API(auth)
                </code></pre>

                <p>The following snippet is specific to my bot: I'm reading through my database of New Yorker images and captions, and grabbing a random set.</p>

                <pre><code>
import glob
# The directory holding the New Yorker images and captions
dirbase = '/Users/karenmckinnon/Dropbox/newyorker/Scrape/Captions/'
dirlocs = glob.glob('%s*' % dirbase)

# Make a list of all the contest numbers
contest_numbers = list()
for dirloc in dirlocs:
parsed = dirloc.split('_')
if len(parsed) == 1: continue
contest_numbers.append(parsed[-1])

# Choose a random contest
import numpy as np
contest_use = np.random.choice(contest_numbers)

# The file containing the image and the captions
image = '%scontest_%s/comic_%s.jpg' % (dirbase, contest_use, contest_use)
captions = '%scontest_%s/contest_%s.json' % (dirbase, contest_use, contest_use)

# Check that the image and caption files actually exist (in some cases, the scraping was unsuccessful for one or the other)
while (not os.path.isfile(image)) | (not os.path.isfile(captions)):
contest_use = np.random.choice(contest_numbers)
image = '%scontest_%s/comic_%s.jpg' % (dirbase, contest_use, contest_use)
captions = '%scontest_%s/contest_%s.json' % (dirbase, contest_use, contest_use)

# Read the file containing all the submitted captions for a given contest
import json
with open(captions, encoding='utf-8') as data:
lines = json.load(data)

# Choose a random caption
this_caption = str(np.random.choice(lines))
                </code></pre>

                <p>And now we can use the API to update the status of our bot with the image and text:</p>

                <pre><code>
status = api.update_with_media(image, status=this_caption)

print('Uploaded caption for contest %s' % (contest_use))
                </code></pre>

                <p>
                    I can now run this script, which I called <code>run_bot.py</code> at the command line via <code>python run_bot.py</code>, and a random image and caption will get uploaded to twitter. But we're not done yet! Ideally, my bot tweet away happily regardless of what I'm doing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For most bots, which tend to focus on retweeting and liking rather than uploading content, a good solution is to keep your bot running all the time on a remote computer, such as an Amazon EC2 instance. Since the bot doesn't require any real compute power, you can get one <a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/">for free</a> for at least 12 months.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At this time, my bot and I are not <i>quite</i> independent. Since I am currently relying on files that are on my own machine, I've set up a cron job to run my script. However, cron jobs only run when a machine is awake; as such, my bot will only share New Yorker comments when I am on my computer (or have otherwise left it awake). I figured that I wanted my bot to tweet about once a day, and that I'm not on my computer at home too much, so I set my cron job to run at the top of every hour. If my computer is awake at that time, my bot will tweet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cron jobs can be a little finicky to work with, but the basic idea is that the user indicates how often the job should run in the <code>crontab</code> file. You can edit your crontab file via <code>crontab -e</code>, which will open up a text editor. My script runs via:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <code>0 * * * * python /Users/karenmckinnon/Documents/twitterbot/run_bot.py > /Users/karenmckinnon/Documents/twitterbot/output.log</code>
                </p>

                <p>
                    where the 0 indicates that the code runs at 0 minutes, and the following four stars mean that it runs every hour, every day of the month, every month, and every day of the week. If my computer was on all the time, I would change it to something like <code>0 0 * * *</code> so that it would run at 0:00UTC each day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can (and should!) follow my New Yorker caption bot at <a href = "https://twitter.com/nyercaptions">@nyercaptions</a>, and create your own!

                </p>

                    A few years ago, when I was in the weeds of my PhD, I found myself in a long conversation with a colleague about what motivated our research. While this may seem like a basic question, it is easy to get lost in the details of disseration research without keeping one's eye on the big picture. After some thought, I realized that, at the end of the day, I was motivated to understand the parts of the earth system that arguably have the largest human impact: temperature and precipitation variability over the global land masses.

                <p>
                    Since then, my research has tackled a number of applied questions. Can we predict heat waves at timescales beyond the typical weather forecast? How is the probability of extreme temperature events changing with time? How uncertain are we about future climate projections because of the inherent, underlying variability of the climate system?

                    As of tomorrow, I'll be taking this trajectory one step further when I join <a href = "https://www.descarteslabs.com/">Descartes Labs</a> as an applied scientist. While the company is doing many cool things (try playing around with the <a href = "https://www.descarteslabs.com/search.html">GeoVisual Search!</a>), I'm particularly excited about working with them to use a wide variety of data sources -- from remote sensing to weather -- in order to improve forecasts of important and relevant quantities like crop yields.

                <p>
                    Thanks to the advent of cheaper satellites, combined with the long-term investment of our governments into various remote sensing platforms, we have an amazing amount of information at our fingertips. Now is an opportune time to figure out how to draw actionable intelligence out of this vast trove of data. I'm excited to join the team at Descartes to see what we can learn.
