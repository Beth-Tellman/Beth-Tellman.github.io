        <h3>Predictions of Eastern US hot days based on the Pacific Extreme Pattern</h3>

        <p>In collaboration with co-authors Andy Rhines, Martin Tingley, and Peter Huybers,
        I recently published a paper regarding long-lead predictions of hot days in the Eastern
        United States. You can find the paper <a href = "http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v9/n5/full/ngeo2687.html">here</a>.</p>

        <p>Each summer since then, I have been making experimental, real-time predictions based on the methodology outlined in the above paper. In short, a specific sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly pattern in the midlatitude Pacific (the Pacific Extreme Pattern) tends to precede hot weather in the Eastern United States at lead times up to seven weeks. We can therefore use the realtime, observed SST anomalies to estimate a probability of hot days over the next seven weeks.</p>

        <p>Below is the most recent SST anomaly data in the Pacific from the NOAA OISSTv2 dataset. The associated date is in the lower righthand corner; the dataset is often a few days delayed. The Pacific Extreme Pattern region is outlined in black.</p>

        <p><img src="./pep_figures/sst.map.current.png" width="700" style="margin:50px 0px"></p>

        <p>Using these observations, we can make predictions over the next 50 days for peak summer hot day probabilities (June 24 - August 22). The gray horizontal line indiciates the climatological probability of a hot day: 15%. Predictions above this line indicate greater-than-average probability of hot weather, while predictions below it indciate lower-than-average probabilities. The thicker black line shows the most recent predictions (i.e. from the most recently observed SSTs), while the progressively lighter lines show predictions over the prior 3 days.</p>

        <h3>Predictions of Eastern US hot days based on the Pacific Extreme Pattern</h3>

        <p>nb: I did not have a chance to validate the 2017 predictions. Below is a discussion of the 2016 predictions, written before the 2017 season.</p>

        <p>So, how did 2016 go? First, a quick recap of how hot days were defined for the purposes of prediction.
        First, we calculated a metric called T95 that was defined as the spatial 95th percentile
        of temperature anomalies in the Eastern US -- in other words, T95 provided the temperature anomaly that
        was exceeded by the hottest 5% of the Eastern US. Then, a hot day was defined as one when
        T95 was greater than 6.5&deg; Celsius, or 11.7&deg; Fahrenheit.</p>

        <p>Many readers may recall that 2016 felt like a very hot summer, with many warnings about heat
        domes and suggestions to stay inside. However, from the perspective of T95, there were only two "hot days"
        during the summer: June 27, and July 23. And these days barely made the cutoff, with values of T95 of
        6.87&deg;C and 6.53&deg;C respectively. Overall, the summer of 2016 had an average T95 of 4.53&deg;C, which is
        just below the average across the prior 34 summers of 4.60&deg;C.</p>

        <p>Why didn't summer 2016 pop out as a very hot summer using our metric? The main reason is
        that T95 only takes into account daily maximum temperature, not relatively humidity. Many of the heat warnings over
        the summer were related to the <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/heat/heat_index.shtml"  target="_blank">heat index</a>, which
        is "is a measure of how hot it really feels when relative humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature."
        This summer highlighted the importance of including humidity in future prediction studies, although historical relative
        humidity data are much more limited than for temperature, which is why the original study focused only on temperature.
        One other factor to keep in mind is that our predictions are for anomalies on top of a linear trend in order to try to remove
        effects of climate change. This formulation was intentional, because we wanted to make sure that we were not simply
        developing a model that could predict a trend, rather than intraseasonal variability in hot weather. That said,
        the Eastern US has not shown large increases in summer daily maximum temperature over the past 35 years (see my recent
        paper <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3608275/published/McKinnonEA2016_JGRA.pdf">here</a>). </p>

        <p>The image below (similar to Supplemental Figures 17-50 from the original paper, which can be found
        <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3608275/published/McKinnonEA2016_NatureGeoscience_SI.pdf">here</a>) summarizes
        the predictions (upper panel) as well as the observed values of T95 (lower panel). The cool colors in the upper panel
        indicate predictions for lower than average probability of hot days, whereas the warm colors indicate higher than
        average probability of hot days as a function of lead time (vertical axis) and date predicted (horizontal axis). For
        most of the summer, the predictor tended to be slightly negative, but rarely deviated too much from average values.</p>

        <p>The lower panel shows the observed values of T95. The gray dashed line indicates the cutoff for a hot day.
        As noted above, two non-consecutive days during the summer exceeded this threshold slightly, but overall the
        summer was average.</p>

        <p><b>To conclude, the predictions for 2016 were relatively accurate. The predictions generally suggested
        that the summer would have slightly lower-than-average probabilities of hot days, and the rate of hot days was
        3% (2 out of 60), which is lower than the climatological rate (15%, or 9 out of 60).</b> </p>

        <p>That said, the summer also emphasized short-comings of the method. First, the predictions were not
        designed to predict an elevated heat index, and so did not provide warning of the humid weather that
        plagued much of the East Coast during peak summer. Second, the predictions are for a relatively large region,
        and so were not able to predict the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/file/august-2016-us-divisional-avg-temp-ranks-mapgif">record warmth in the Northeast during August</a>.</p>
