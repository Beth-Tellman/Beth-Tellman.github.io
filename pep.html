        <h3>Predictions of Eastern US hot days based on the Pacific Extreme Pattern</h3>



        <p>In collaboration with co-authors Andy Rhines, Martin Tingley, and Peter Huybers,
        I recently published a paper regarding long-lead predictions of hot days in the Eastern
        United States. You can find the paper <a href = "http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v9/n5/full/ngeo2687.html">here</a>.</p>

        <p>During the summer of 2016, I made experimental predictions for hot days using the methodology outlined in the above paper. 
        So, how did it go?</p>
        
        <p>First, a quick recap of how hot days were defined for the purposes of prediction. 
        First, we calculated a metric called T95 that was defined as the spatial 95th percentile 
        of temperature anomalies in the Eastern US -- in other words, T95 provided the temperature anomaly that 
        was exceeded by the hottest 5% of the Eastern US. Then, a hot day was defined as one when 
        T95 was greater than 6.5&deg; Celsius, or 11.7&deg; Fahrenheit.</p>
        
        <p>Many readers may recall that 2016 felt like a very hot summer, with many warnings about heat 
        domes and suggestions to stay inside. However, from the perspective of T95, there were only two "hot days" 
        during the summer: June 27, and July 23. And these days barely made the cutoff, with values of T95 of 
        6.87&deg;C and 6.53&deg;C respectively. Overall, the summer of 2016 had an average T95 of 4.53&deg;C, which is 
        just below the average across the prior 34 summers of 4.60&deg;C.</p>
        
        <p>Why didn't summer 2016 pop out as a very hot summer using our metric? The main reason is 
        that T95 only takes into account daily maximum temperature, not relatively humidity. Many of the heat warnings over 
        the summer were related to the <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/heat/heat_index.shtml"  target="_blank">heat index</a>, which 
        is "is a measure of how hot it really feels when relative humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature." 
        This summer highlighted the importance of including humidity in future prediction studies, although historical relative 
        humidity data are much more limited than for temperature, which is why the original study focused only on temperature. 
        One other factor to keep in mind is that our predictions are for anomalies on top of a linear trend in order to try to remove 
        effects of climate change. This formulation was intentional, because we wanted to make sure that we were not simply 
        developing a model that could predict a trend, rather than intraseasonal variability in hot weather. That said, 
        the Eastern US has not shown large increases in summer daily maximum temperature over the past 35 years (see my recent 
        paper <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3608275/published/McKinnonEA2016_JGRA.pdf">here</a>). </p>
        
        <p>The image below (similar to Supplemental Figures 17-50 from the original paper, which can be found 
        <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3608275/published/McKinnonEA2016_NatureGeoscience_SI.pdf">here</a>) summarizes 
        the predictions (upper panel) as well as the observed values of T95 (lower panel). The cool colors in the upper panel 
        indicate predictions for lower than average probability of hot days, whereas the warm colors indicate higher than 
        average probability of hot days as a function of lead time (vertical axis) and date predicted (horizontal axis). For 
        most of the summer, the predictor tended to be slightly negative, but rarely deviated too much from average values.</p>
        
        <p>The lower panel shows the observed values of T95. The gray dashed line indicates the cutoff for a hot day. 
        As noted above, two non-consecutive days during the summer exceeded this threshold slightly, but overall the
        summer was average.</p>

        <p><b>To conclude, the predictions for 2016 were relatively accurate. The predictions generally suggested 
        that the summer would have slightly lower-than-average probabilities of hot days, and the rate of hot days was 
        3% (2 out of 60), which is lower than the climatological rate (15%, or 9 out of 60).</b> </p>
        
        <p>That said, the summer also emphasized short-comings of the method. First, the predictions were not 
        designed to predict an elevated heat index, and so did not provide warning of the humid weather that 
        plagued much of the East Coast during peak summer. Second, the predictions are for a relatively large region, 
        and so were not able to predict the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/file/august-2016-us-divisional-avg-temp-ranks-mapgif">record warmth in the Northeast during August</a>.</p>
